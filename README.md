# Text-Based Tic Tac Toe Game (Python)

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Python that runs directly in the command-line interface (CLI). This project demonstrates basic game logic, user interaction, and control flow in Python.

---

## **Overview**  
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This version is a text-based game that runs in the terminal, allowing two players to take turns and interact via the command line.

## **Features**
- Two-player turn-based game (Player X vs. Player O)
- Text-based interface
- Simple logic to check for winners and detect ties
- Error handling for invalid moves
- Displays the updated board after each move

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (3.7+)
